Ah, get away![NL]
I don't wish to...[A][NL]
I don't wish to hurt you...[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
Calm down, calm down![A][NL]
I don't wish to harm you as well.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][OpenEyes]
You don't wish to harm me...?[A][NL]
Why is that?[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
You don't like you are happy here.[A][NL]
You feel out of place,[NL]
on this weird named cave.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
But... Don't you know?[A][NL]
Those monsters that are being[NL]
summoned are my fault...[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Um, why is that?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
My mother was a powerfull summoner[NL]
and I inherited her powers.[A][NL]
But I'm nowhere near her mastery in[NL]
these arts.[A][NL]
So she created a special armlet that[NL]
when I'm wearing it, I can control[A][NL]
my powers correctly.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
And why aren't you wearing it then?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
That man, he took it from me[A]
and forced me to work to him.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft]
So... While you're alive, those[NL]
monsters will keep spawning.[A][NL]
Am I right?[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Yes...[A][NL][OpenEyes]
Unless I wear the armlet.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Grab my hand.[A][NL][MoveRight]
Let's recover that armlet together.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
Oh![A][NL][X]
