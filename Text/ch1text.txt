would come to see me.[A][ToggleSmile][CloseSpeechFast]
[OpenLeft]
[ToggleSmile]Yes father, I[NL]

Agryllian soldiers, here? Damn![A][NL]
I guess we have no choice.[NL]
We must fight back.[A]
[OpenFarFarLeft][LoadFace][0x01][0x01]
Young prince, wait![A][MoveMidLeft][2NL]
Allow me to accompany you on your journey.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But father, you cannot fight![A]
[OpenMidLeft]

I carry can heal your wounded.[A][2NL]
Take me with you, and[NL]
you'll be very glad you did.[A][X]

Damn, it seems that the[NL]
Agryllians are everywhere.[A][NL]
If only there were someplace that they[NL]
couldn't follow us to[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Why not cut through Chendol?[A][NL]
We won't meet resistance[NL]
from Agryllia there.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Chendol is neutral in our conflict.[A][2NL]
They may consider our presence[NL]
there to be an act of war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
That's a risk we'll have to take.[A][X]
