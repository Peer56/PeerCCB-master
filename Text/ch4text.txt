[MidRight]We've made it here now.[N]
It should be a matter of time.[A]
[MidLeft]For what, Raphael?[A]
[MidRight]I have the feeling that[N]
Agryllia has a base in here.[ANL]
They have a hold of this[N]
mountain village.[ANL]
[MidLeft]We have a big enough[N]
squad, sire. Don't worry.[ANL]
If we manage to conscript[N]
more soldiers,[ANL]
we'll be able to outlast[N]
them more than our numbers.[A]

[MidRight]Excuse me, sir?[A]
[Left]Ah, soldiers of Agryllia.[N]
What brings you to me,[AN]
such a worthless, pure soul?[A]
[MidRight]We've came out of the[N]
words that there was a bard,[AN]
who had just the knowledge[N]
we seek.[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]Knowledge, you say?[N]
I will be glad to share.[AN]
What'll it be? A song by the[N]
name of "Distant Roads"[A][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight]Actually, it's about[N]
something important.[A]
Do you happen to know about[N]
the legendary weapons?[A]
[Left]I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] really have no[N]
idea of what you're talking of.[A]
[MidRight]Oh, come on, kid.[N]
We've heard of the Wise Voice.[A]
Lucian, who knows it all.[N]
Is that supposed to be you?[A]
If it is, then tell us:[N]
How can we find them, and-[A]
[Left]I will tell you once more.[N]
I don't know anything.[A]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]Okay, kid. What do ye'[N]
think if we bargain?[ANL]
Ye' give us that shiny harp[N]
'n we let ye' go this time.[A][ToggleSmile]
[Left]So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You want to[N]
take the harp I play with?[ANL]
You would take away the[N]
instrument of a poor man?[ANL]
You would take away the smiles[N]
of a thousand children?[ANL]
[MidRight]Wha[ToggleMouthMove]...?![ToggleMouthMove][MoveMidRight][NL]
That's not what I-[A]
[Left]How repugnable. You two[N]
really have no shame.[A]
[FarFarLeft][LoadVillager]
[FarFarLeft][MoveMidLeft]How dare you do this?[N]
To a bard, no less![ANL]
Out with you![N]
Out, I say![ANL]
I'm sure you would even[N]
hurt a kid for such a rumor![A]
[MidRight]G-Geh! W-We apologize, jeez![N]
C'mon, let's go, mate.[A][ClearFace]
[Right]This isn't the end![N]
You'll regret this![A][ClearFace]

Lucian just got in trouble[N]

[Left][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]What did they do?[A]

I refused to give them[N]

reckless ever again, Lucian![ANL]

[MidLeft]Oh dear, what is it?[A]
[FarRight]Gorias has sent his[N]

Oh no! Lucian, look.[ANL]
You've got to head out[N]

Nala and I will do our[N]
best to drive them away.[ANL]
[Right]No way! I don't want[N]
to lose any of you![A]
[FarRight]Wait, boy! The good[N]
news dictate the following:[ANL]
A man in blue armor is[N]
coming over.[ANL]
Some say it is the famed[N]
prince Raphael.[A]
[Right] Sir Raphael! I must[N]
meet up with him at once![ANL]
Where have you seen him,[N]

Prepare yourself.[A]
[MidLeft]No, wait, Cyrus. They[N]

They look like a bard,[N]
in fact.[A]
[FarFarRight][LoadLucian]
[FarFarRight][MoveRight]
[Right]Good morning, sir. Are you,[N]
by chance, Prince Raphael?[AN]
[MidLeft]That's me.[N]
Who are you?[A]

a brilliant mind and soul.[ANL]
My name's Lucian, and I[N]
wish to inquire your help.[A]
[MidLeft]Alright. May I ask what[N]
troubles you?[A]
[Right]It happens that I know[N]
about the weapons of legend.[ANL]
However, I was cornered and[N]
questioned by Agryllian soldiers.[ANL]
They are trying to get a[N]
hold of my knowledge.[A]
[Left]Your knowledge? What kind of[N]
secret do they want from you?[A]
[Right]They seek to pry out[N]
important information from me.[ANL]
They tried to take my harp[N]
for what I knew about it:[ANL]
They want to know about the[N]
legendary weapons.[A]
[MidLeft]The[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][MoveMidLeft]What?[A]

I see you've made new friends.[A]
[FarFarLeft][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[Right]Well, it won't serve you[N]
much right now.[ANL]
Now that our boss is here, he[N]
will make a better bargain.[A][ToggleSmile]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight]So, this is the puny bard[N]
who drove you off?[ANL]
Well, I shall handle it[N]
this way, kid:[ANL]
Either you give us the harp[N]
and go home[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ANL]
Or we will codemn the place[N]
you call home. Understood?![A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
[FarLeft]I won't let harm fall upon[N]
the innocent civilians.[ANL]
Causing huge casualties and[N]
conmotion is unfair![A]
[MidRight]Well, well, well.[N]
If it isn't Prince Raphael.[ANL]
I've heard a lot about you;[N]
nothing good about it, to say.[ANL]
How about you step aside and[N]
let me do my job?[ANL]
You wouldn't be match for me[N]
and the Karpat Ein![ANL]
Gwah hah hah hah![A]
[FarLeft]My army may be small, but[N]
we've gone through worse.[ANL]
We won't let you lay harm[N]
upon anyone just for a harp.[A]
[MidRight]Hmph, reckless, I see?[ANL]
Let's see how much strength[N]
you have, prince.[ANL]
Hopefully, it may be enough[N]
to tackle a powerhouse like me[ANL]

We won't let this go unsettled.[A]
[Left]Thank you, prince. I have[N]
a family to protect.[ANL]
Your help is kindly[N]
appreciated.[A]
[FarRight]I suggest preparing ourselves[N]
as much as possible[ANL]
I heard the Karpat Ein is[N]
a powerful unit of Agryllia.[ANL]
Their [Red]Fiery Blood[Red] makes[N]
them stand out in power.[A]
[MidRight]Alright. We should be[N]
careful and plan accordingly.[ANL]
One slip-up, and it may cost[N]
us dearly.[A]

[MidRight]Lucian, what abilities do[N]
you possess, other than sing?[A]
[MidLeft]I am not called the[N]
[Red]Wise Bard[Red] for nothing.[ANL]
My songs bring inspiration[N]

I did learn how to use[N]
divine magic as well.[A]
[MidRight]That sounds really helpful.[N]
Let's march on, everyone![A][X]

you come to see my wares?[ANL]
Wait, a bandit attack?[N]
Thank you for warning us.[ANL]
Here, I got you a fine robe[N]
as a thanks.[ANL]
It was worn by my daughter[N]
for her graduation as a sage.[ANL]
I barely remember the happy[N]
days before the Agryllian attacks.[ANL]
She's still alive, but she asked[N]
me to do anything with it.[ANL]

[MidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF]
[MidLeft]I told you I did my taxes[N]
already, you fat- [MoveMidLeft]Oh![ANL]
My apologies, sir. You got me[N]
for a second there![ANL]
Listen up, because I will[N]
say something important.[ANL]
Gorias is in command of the[N]
powerful Karpat Ein, as you know.[ANL]
However, you must be careful[N]
of a certain part of his forces.[ANL]
His Ballistae are carefully[N]
stationed to take you out.[ANL]
Their purpose is to stop the[N]
airborne threats.[ANL]
Then, there's his powerful[N]
Wyvern Riders,[ANL]
who sit in the small island[N]
to the south of the bridge.[ANL]
Use your Archers or Mages to[N]
knock them off.[ANL]
Lastly, there's his pair of[N]
loyal, hired Hunters.[ANL]
They both ride in horseback[N]
and strike with bow and sword.[ANL]
If you're not careful, they[N]
may take your life.[ANL]
So, think accordinly:[AN]
Either you surround them[N]
and attack them all at once,[ANL]
or allow a strong unit do[N]
the job. Be careful![A][X]

villages and lives.[ANL]
I[MoveMidLeft]-I mean, I have[N]
